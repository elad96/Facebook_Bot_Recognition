# Facebook_Bot_Recognition
Machine Learning project for social media bot recognition(Facebook), using meta and language features.  

By using Selenium based web scraper, I scrapped around 10 million comments from facebook (Stored in elasticsearch server).  
This project purpose, is to extract meta & language features and develop machine learning model, which will be able to predict if a user is a bot or not.
