# Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting bot accounts on the social media platform Facebook. The model will leverage metadata and language features extracted from user comments to distinguish between genuine human users and automated bots.

# Data Collection
To obtain the necessary data for training and evaluation, a Selenium-based web scraper was utilized to collect approximately 10 million comments from Facebook. These comments were stored in an Elasticsearch server for efficient data management and retrieval.

# Primary Projcet objectives:
  **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant metadata and linguistic features from the scraped Facebook comments. These features may include comment timestamps, language patterns, sentiment analysis, and other relevant attributes.
  **Model Development:** Develop a machine learning model that can effectively learn from the extracted features and accurately predict whether a user is a bot or a human.
  **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Expected Outcomes
By successfully completing this project, we expect to achieve the following outcomes:
    A machine learning model capable of accurately identifying bot accounts on Facebook based on their commenting patterns and metadata.
    Insights into the distinguishing features and characteristics of bot accounts compared to human users on social media platforms.
    Potential contributions to the broader effort of maintaining the integrity of online communities and fostering authentic interactions on social media.

# Technologies and Tools
This project will leverage the following technologies and tools:
    **Selenium:** For web scraping and data collection from Facebook.
    **Elasticsearch:** For efficient storage and retrieval of the scraped comments.
    **Python:** The primary programming language for data processing, feature extraction, and model development.
    **Machine Learning Libraries:** Popular libraries such as scikit-learn for building and evaluating the bot detection model.
    **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:** Libraries like NLTK for text preprocessing and linguistic feature extraction.
